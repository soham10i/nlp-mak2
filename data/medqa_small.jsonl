{"question":"A 3-month-old boy is brought the emergency department by his parents after an episode of cyanosis and muscle hypotonia that resolved after 2 minutes. Diagnostic evaluation fails to discover an exact etiology of the boy's symptoms and the episode is classified as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection.
